        <h1 >Definition</h1>
        <p>Climate change mitigation refers to efforts to reduce or prevent the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. Mitigation strategies aim to limit the magnitude of future global warming and climate change by reducing the sources or enhancing the sinks of GHGs. These efforts can include adopting new technologies, improving energy efficiency, altering management practices, and changing consumer behaviour.</p>
